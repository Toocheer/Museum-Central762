But in fact, the locomotives named JMY380 are several models from different manufacturers. The reason for this phenomenon is that the models of China's industrial and mining diesel locomotives have the following naming rules:<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>：</p> <blockquote><p>The first letter indicates the product type：</p> <ul><li>J (Chinese: 机车, pinyin: <em>Ji che</em>, lit. &quot;locomotives&quot;)</li></ul> <p>The second letter indicates the working environment：</p> <ul><li><p>M (Chinese: 地面, pinyin: <em>di Mian</em>, lit. &quot;suitable for ground use&quot;)</p></li> <li><p>X (Chinese: 井巷, pinyin: <em>jing Xiang</em>, lit. &quot;suitable for underground tunnel&quot;)</p></li></ul> <p>The third letter indicates the transmission mode：</p> <ul><li><p>Y (Chinese: 液力, pinyin: <em>Ye li</em>, lit. &quot;Diesel-Hydraulic, adopts torque converter&quot;)</p></li> <li><p>D (Chinese: 电力, pinyin: <em>Dian li</em>, lit. &quot;Diesel-Electric&quot;)</p></li> <li><p>J (Chinese: 液压, pinyin: <em>Ye ya</em>, lit. &quot;Diesel-Hydraulic, adopts pump and cylinder&quot;)</p></li> <li><p>[void]  (Mechanical transmission)</p></li></ul> <p>The following three digits indicate the horsepower.</p></blockquote> <p>The suffix letters after the number indicate the characteristics of the locomotive. Currently, it can only be confirmed that KB (Chinese: 抗爆, pinyin: <em>Kang Bao</em>) stands for &quot;explosion-proof&quot; (suitable for flammable and explosive environments such as coal mines). The actual suffix letters include M, B, SH, ZR, SF, FA, FD, etc. A large number of subtypes have no extant images, and their meanings have not yet been confirmed.</p> <p>So the meaning of the JMY380 model is &quot;a 380-horsepower hydraulic transmission diesel locomotive suitable for ground use&quot;. According to the naming method of the standard gauge locomotive of Chinese National Railway, the model of the diesel hydraulic transmission locomotive is NY, so many 380-horsepower diesel locomotives are written as NY380 on the nameplate. The manufacturers that produce the JMY380 and NY380 series locomotives include Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory (Chinese: 石家庄动力机械厂, Brand: &quot;太行&quot;, pinyin: <em>Taihang</em>), Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory (Chinese: 长沙矿山通用机械厂), Jiangsu Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory (Chinese: 江苏常州内燃机车厂, Brand: &quot;今创&quot;, pinyin: <em>Jinchuang</em>), etc. Some locomotives have models assigned by the manufacturer, such as the products of Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory, the common 380-horsepower hydraulic transmission narrow-gauge locomotive Model &quot;Taihang 52A&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;金马&quot;, pinyin: <em>Jinma</em>, a production model of JMY380A Ⅲ, to be confirmed) and the &quot;WHY380&quot; series products produced by Changzhou Wanhang Machinery Equipment Factory (Chinese: 常州万航机械设备厂).</p> <p>It can be seen that JMY380 does not refer to a specific model, but a &quot;family&quot; of 380-horsepower diesel locomotives. These locomotives have different shapes, with whether inner or outer corridors, single or double cabs, and support various track gauges from 750, 762, 900, 1067 to 1435 mm. In addition, since 380 horsepower can be approximately converted to 279 kilowatts, there are also some locomotives marked as JMY279, such as the JMY279 standard-gauge/narrow-gauge dual-purpose diesel locomotive jointly developed by Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory and Jinan Iron and Steel Factory. This article mainly discusses several 762 mm gauge 380 horsepower diesel locomotives used in Henan local railway system, hereinafter referred to as &quot;JMY380 locomotive family&quot;.</p> <p>The JMY380 locomotive family is responsible for the main trunk passenger and freight transportation of the Chao-Qi Narrow-Gauge Railway, Yu-Dan Narrow-Gauge Railway, Zhu-Ru Narrow-Gauge Railway and other major lines of Henan local railway system. In addition, this type of locomotive is also widely used in factories and mines in various places, including Mudanjiang Northern Cement Plant, Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Plant, Ma'anshan Taochong Mining and other well-known narrow-gauge lines. Among them, the 380-horsepower narrow-gauge locomotive produced by Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory was rated as a high-quality product and excellent new product in Hebei Province in 1983. &quot;It is well received by users and the products are sold well in 26 provinces, cities and autonomous regions in China, and the output increases year by year.&quot;<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>。</p> <h3 id="technical-features-of-jmy380-family">Technical features of JMY380 family</h3> <ul><li>Rated power: 279 kW (380 hp)</li> <li>Fuel consumption rate: 238 g/kW · h (175 g/hp · h)</li> <li>Gauge: 762 mm (2 ft 6 in)</li> <li>UIC axle arrangements: B-B</li> <li>wheel diameter: 600 mm (1 ft 11⅝ in)</li> <li>Wheelbase: 1500 mm (4 ft 11 in)</li> <li>Curb weight: 24 t</li> <li>Axle load: 6 t</li> <li>Minimum curve radius: 60 m</li> <li>Maximum speed: 45 km/h (28 mph)</li> <li>Tractive effort: 7.92 kN (1780 lbf) continuous at 13.5 km/h (8.64 mph)<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></li></ul> <p>This is a drawing of a JMY380 locomotive produced by Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory.<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>From the following observations, it can be found that the Changsha Mining General Locomotive Factory also produced a version of the same locomotive based on this drawing. This inner corridor JMY380 locomotive is mainly composed of three compartments, from left to right, namely the driver's cab, the machinery room, and the non-operating driver's cab (referred to as the &quot;rear engine room&quot; in the figure below). The main instruments, handwheels, and brakes in the driver's cab are arranged on the right, which is different from the China Railway standard-gauge locomotives. A Model 12V135Z diesel engine and a hydraulic transmission assembly, as well as a cooling fan are installed in the machinery room. Fuel and water are both added from the top, and no oil pump is required for fuel supply. The drive shaft and air cylinder are installed at the bottom. There are no seats and instruments installed in the non-operating driver's cab. In the model shown in the figure below, the non-operating driver's cab is much shorter than the driver's cab, and there is only a triangular window on the side.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-3faa05799bb7470b3fee0c11361f8c30_r.jpg" alt="Drawing of JMY380 locomotive of Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory"></p></center> <center class="subtext">Drawing of JMY380 locomotive of Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory</center> <hr> <h3 id="introduction-to-chao-qi-railway-locomotive-cemetery">Introduction to Chao-Qi Railway Locomotive Cemetery</h3> <p>The abandoned locomotives and stocks on Chao-Qi Railway are mainly concentrated in Paofang and Chuankou stations. Several repaired locomotives are parked in the garage of Yujian Railway Park at Chaoyanggou Station, including three JMY380 locomotives of two types, &quot;Taihang 52A&quot; and Xuchang-produced 380 horsepower. Paofang Station is located in Daye Town, Dengfeng, Zhengzhou, Henan Province. It was opened and used with Chao-Wei Section in 1976 and was decommissioned around 2013, with no buildings in the station but three existing lines. The abandoned locomotives with a spectacular sight as many as 19 locomotives. Among them, 3 (Codename: 炮房1-炮房3) are painted blue and white, and the rest (Codename: 炮房4-炮房19) are painted orange by Xinzheng Branch. A northbound branch line is drawn from the east side of Paofang Station, where a row of abandoned open car bottoms are parked. In some materials, Paofang Station is also called Paofanggou Station (Chinese: 炮房沟站 or 炮坊沟站). Paofang Station is the third station from the west of Chao-Qi Railway. It is 6 kilometers west of Chaoyanggou Station at the western, 3 kilometers from the previous station Chuankou Station, 2 kilometers east of the next station Daye Station, and 162 kilometers from Qixian Station at the eastern end.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-e50b5b02d0f404abfd47c7f67d4cebbd_r.jpg" alt="Panoramic view of abandoned locomotives stored at Paofang Station"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Panoramic view of abandoned locomotives stored at Paofang Station</center> <p>Chuankou Station (Chinese: 川口站), located in Daye Town, Dengfeng District, Zhengzhou, Henan Province, opened in 1976 with the Chao-Wei Section and closed around 2013. Currently, Chuankou Station maintains a locomotive maintenance depot and has undergone renovations to prepare for the Chao-Qi Railway's development into a tourist route. The station houses two open wagons, flat cars, and other freight trains, four blue-and-white 380-horsepower diesel locomotives, and the tender for a C2 steam locomotive (north side of Codename: 川口1). Two of these locomotives (Codename: 川口3 and 川口4) have had their running gear removed and moved to opposite sides of the line. Chuankou Station is the second western station on the Chao-Qi Railway, 3 kilometers west of Chaoyanggou Station, 3 kilometers east of the next station, Paofang Station, and 166 kilometers east of Qixian Station.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-0c8d8f6d4c61c34520a67a83bb92650a_r.jpg" alt="Panorama of abandoned locomotives stored at Chuankou Station"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Panorama of abandoned locomotives stored at Chuankou Station</center> <p>The above-mentioned 19 locomotives at Chuankou Station and 4 at Chuankou Station, totaling 23 locomotives, all belong to the JMY380 narrow-gauge diesel locomotive family.</p> <h3 id="model-identification-of-abandoned-locomotives">Model identification of abandoned locomotives</h3> <h4 id="ny380-by-changsha-mining-general-machinery-factory">NY380 by Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory</h4> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-d4edf63f05be27196b540204af875817_r.jpg" alt="炮房19, No.新机3820"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">炮房19, No.新机3820</center> <p>The NY380 locomotive, manufactured by the Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory, is virtually identical in appearance to the Changzhou JMY380 locomotive drawings mentioned above.

The front face of the locomotive near the engine room has an inspection opening between the two auxiliary lights, while the front face near the cooling room has none. The driver's cab layout is different, with only two side windows on one end, presumably for one-way operation. The Shijiazhuang-issued NY380 lacks a folding line on the front, and the auxiliary lights are positioned low. The engine room has six side windows, each in a group of two, with cooling vents at the bottom. Both the Shijiazhuang-version NY380 (川口2) and the Changsha-version NY380 (炮房17) bear the number 3816, with 炮房17 bearing the inscription &quot;新机&quot;(pinyin: Xinji, lit. Xinxiang Depot) Since the Xuchang Locomotive Depot also used a blue and white livery, it is speculated that the former may have come from a discarded or abandoned vehicle in Xuchang.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-c4620b049474a1208e70428aae1799a9_r.jpg" alt=""></p></center> <h4 id="_380hp-diesel-locomotive-by-xuchang-locomotive-and-rolling-stock-factory">380hp diesel locomotive by Xuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory</h4> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-cacfed94ece6d8cc31c75e4272cd29ff_r.jpg" alt=""></p></center> <p>The 380-horsepower locomotive manufactured by Xuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory of Henan Local Railway is the easiest to distinguish among the JMY380 family, because it is the only single driver's room model among the existing JMY380s of Chao-Qi Railway. No nameplate was found for several retained locomotives of this type. According to the naming habits of the previous products of Xuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, this locomotive may be called &quot;XC-380&quot;. The Xuchang 380-horsepower locomotive has differences in the side wall of the mechanical room and the II end headlights. As shown in the figure below, the window of the mechanical room of the 炮房18 has become a cooling hole, and an additional window is added behind the driver's room; the 炮房15 and 炮房18 are both different from the 炮房6, and there is only one window behind the cooling room of the latter.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-6738cf059fec3699fac2d07f9eaa00bb_r.jpg" alt="Side comparison of 炮房15 and 炮房18"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Side comparison of 炮房15 and 炮房18</center> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-d5f74e898f9ab277b46a13a278749373_r.jpg" alt="炮房12, No.新机38□4"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">炮房12, No.新机38□4</center> <center><p><img src="https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-884266f04874e43ec04413f42fdbb4f5_r.jpg" alt="Train No.新机3804 after restoration at Chaoyanggou Station"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Train No.新机3804 after restoration at Chaoyanggou Station</center> <p>Among the three diesel locomotives currently being repaired at Chaoyanggou Station, one is a Xuchang 380-horsepower locomotive.</p> <h4 id="ny380m-by-jiangsu-changzhou-diesel-locomotive-factory">NY380M by Jiangsu Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory</h4> <center><p><img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-54fd62bb01ccb39b31fd99bc165d82d0_r.jpg" alt="炮房14, locomotive number unknown"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">炮房14, locomotive number unknown</center> <p>There were two vehicles of this type: one designated No.3814 (炮房16), whose paint job differed from the others, possibly originally being red rather than orange.

Another characteristic of this model is the rounded corners of the auxiliary headlights. 炮房5 (No.3808) has slightly different auxiliary and headlights, possibly due to its previous accident. The second end and left side of the locomotive are largely destroyed.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-11e489c9945a2de4e2a09b2a24f901af_r.jpg" alt="The control consoles of the No.3808 locomotive"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">The control consoles of the No.3808 locomotive</center> <h4 id="unknown-model-b-taihang-52a-like-locomotive">Unknown Model B: &quot;Taihang 52A-like&quot; locomotive</h4> <center><p><img src="https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-25187a997fe709868435ec09e224a3f7_r.jpg" alt="川口3, locomotive number unknown"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">川口3, locomotive number unknown</center> <p>This locomotive is the only one among the abandoned locomotives of the Chao-Qi Railway.

Since the running gear of this locomotive (川口3) is missing, and its nameplate is missing, further comparison between the two is impossible.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-5767c7c42962b869fcfe2a8fbdfd7bac_r.jpg" alt="Abandoned Taihang 52A diesel locomotive at Laojunmiao Station on the Zhu-Ru Railway"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Abandoned Taihang 52A diesel locomotive at Laojunmiao Station on the Zhu-Ru Railway</center> <h4 id="unknown-model-c-changsha-ny380-like-locomotives">Unknown Model C: &quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotives.</h4> <p>These locomotives are very similar to the Changsha NY380 in all aspects, with the only difference being the lack of ventilation holes above the cooling chamber, while the Changsha version does. However, due to the missing nameplate, it is impossible to determine whether they are Changsha NY380s. Literature indicates that the Changsha-version NY380 was also produced by the Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory, leading to speculation that these locomotives may be versions produced in Changzhou using similar drawings, or products of the Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory at different stages.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-247f5e18c0e76dc92630cec4f9ca8436_r.jpg" alt="&quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotives"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">&quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotives</center> <h4 id="unknown-model-d-changsha-ny380-like-locomotive-single-auxiliary-light">Unknown model D: &quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotive (single auxiliary light)</h4> <p>Most of the features of this locomotive are similar to the above three Changsha NY380-like locomotives, but it has only one auxiliary light on each side, which is the only one among all the abandoned locomotives of Chao-Qi Railway.</p> <center><p><img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-c66499f3ffd5f94f2f2f501aff15c6f4_r.jpg" alt="Single-headlight locomotive"></p></center> <center class="subtext mb-3">Single-headlight locomotive</center> <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3> <p>The abandoned locomotives in the Chao-Qi Railway Locomotive Cemetery are of the following types:</p> <ol><li><p>Changsha Mining General Machinery Factory NY380: 5 units in total (The codenames in this article are 炮房7, 炮房10, 炮房13, 炮房17, and 炮房19)</p></li> <li><p>Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory NY380: 4 units in total (The codenames in this article are 川口1 and 川口2, 炮房1 and 炮房3)</p></li> <li><p>Xuchang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory 380 horsepower single cab: 4 units in total (The codenames in this article are 炮房6, 炮房12, 炮房15, and 炮房18)</p></li> <li><p>Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory NY380M: 2 units in total (The codenames in this article are 炮房14 and 炮房16)</p></li> <li><p>Changzhou Diesel Locomotive Factory JMY380SH: 1 unit in total (The codename in this article is 炮房8)</p></li> <li><p>Unknown model A &quot;bi-directional control cab 380hp locomotive&quot;: 2 units in total (The codenames in this article are 炮房4 and 炮房5)</p></li> <li><p>Unknown model B &quot;Taihang 52A-like&quot; locomotive: 1 unit in total (The codename in this article is 川口3)</p></li> <li><p>Unknown Model C &quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotive: 3 units total (The codenames in this article are 川口4, 炮房9 and 炮房11)</p></li> <li><p>Unknown Model D &quot;Changsha NY380-like&quot; locomotive (single auxiliary headlight): 1 unit total (The codename in this article is 炮房2)</p></li></ol> <p>Type 8 and Type 9 may be merged into Type 1.</p> <p>This collection of abandoned locomotives demonstrates that the Chao-Qi Railway, as a key narrow-gauge line in Henan Province, utilized a wide variety of locomotives.
