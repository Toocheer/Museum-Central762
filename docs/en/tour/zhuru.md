## Laojunmiao Station

Laojunmiao Station is located in Xiaotun Village, Laojunmiao Town, Runan County, Henan Province. The Zhu-Ru Line and Lao-Du Line meet here. The station was put into passenger operation in 1993 and stopped in 2003. With the development of road transportation, the narrow-gauge system was gradually discontinued. There were dozens of severely rusted abandoned locomotives and carriages, but they were demolished in early 2025.
