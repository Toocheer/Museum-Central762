::: slot preface
### Connecting with the homeland and galloping across the Central China
:::

In the late 1950s, Henan Province began to build local railways. Over the past half century, 16 local railway lines have traversed the Central China, with a total length of more than 1,600 kilometers. 

Local railways were born in the Great Leap Forward era to meet the rapidly growing needs of coal, steel and timber transportation. This historical background derived a series of imaginative creations, such as wooden tracks, locomobile and handmade carriages, which brought unexpected economic benefits, and were gradually standardized and operated by local governments and flourished. 

With the continuous evolution of modern transportation technology, local railways with low standards and small transportation volumes have gradually lost their advantages, and their ecological niches have been gradually eroded by roads. 

Around 2010s, these narrow-gauge railways were discontinued one after another, some of which have been demolished, and others are still hidden in the wilderness of the Central China. Few people know that Henan once had the most developed narrow-gauge railway system in my country. Welcome to Central 762, a Museum for Narrow-gauge Railways in China, and start an exploration journey about China's Narrow-gauge railway.
