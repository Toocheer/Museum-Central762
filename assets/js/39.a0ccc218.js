Yuxian County is located in the northeast of Shanxi Province and is rich in mineral resources. Since 1957, Yuxian County has built power plants and steel plants without any industry. In just one year, the county has developed thousands of factories and mines with more than 20,000 workers, forming an industrial structure dominated by heavy industry. However, what is unbalanced with the rapid development of industry is that there were only four cars in the county at that time, which was far from meeting the transportation needs of raw materials and products of enterprises.
